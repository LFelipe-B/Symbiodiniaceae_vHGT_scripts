# Symbiodiniaceae_vHGT_scripts

This repository contains scripts, examples and some results from the paper "Multiple waves of viral invasions in Symbiodiniaceae algal genomes" by Benites, Stephens and Bhattacharya (2022), to generate horizontal gene transfer indexes and calculations between the dinoflagellate algae Symbiodiniaceae and viruses.

# Update in August 2022 
- Protein multifasta file with all Symbiodiniaceae vHGTs: Symbiodiniaceae_vHGT_protein_sequences.fasta

# Content:
- script to fetch full taxonomy from diamond output: GetTaxID_table_V3.pl

- example file from a diamond blastp output with taxonomic identification of subject hits: Symbiodinium_microadriaticum_XDIAMOND_NR_50hits_Full_taxIDs_clean.csv

- script to calculate HGT indexes "Alien Index (AI)" and "HGT index (hU)" from a diamond output with taxonomic identification: Get_HGT_indexes_V5.py

- script to calculate the sum of bitscore between a target and non-target taxa from a diamond output with taxonomic identification: Get_HGT_bitscore_sum_V1.py

- script to calculate the taxonomic distribution from a diamond output with taxonomic identification: Get_HGT_tax_distribution_V5.py
# results from these calculations (raw and final)
